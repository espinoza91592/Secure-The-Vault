//Algorithm To Find the Secret Vault


// To solve this problem, you need to calculate the vault codes
// by using arithmetics and store them in variables
// Then display a welcome message to the sage cracker
// with the secret combination

// Create a variable named first Num that will store
// The result of 5+5
const firstNum = 5 + 5;

// Create a variable secondNum that will store
// the result of 10*4
const secondNum = 10 * 4;

// Create a variable thirdNum that will calculate the
// difference between 50 and 11
const thirdNum = 50 - 11;

//Display welcom message to the safe cracker
const string ='You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:'
